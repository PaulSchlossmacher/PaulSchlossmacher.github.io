- Semester project on the topic of *Post-selection inference for high-dimensional data*  
- Compared a newly introduced *carving* estimator to established estimators. Identified theoretical limitations of the new estimator and demonstrated through simulations that the existing estimators achieved higher power while controlling the family-wise error rate.
